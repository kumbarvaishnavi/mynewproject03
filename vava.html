<h1>POEM1</h1>
<h2>THE ROSE FAMILY </h2>
<pre><p>
The rose is a rose,
And was always a rose.
But the theroy now goes 
That the apple's a rose,
And the pear is,and so's
The plum, I supose.
The dear only knows
What wil next prove a rose.
You, of course, are a rose -
But were always a rose.
</p>
<b><u><i>POEM2
<u><b><i>AWAKING IN BENGALURU</u></b></i>
<pre><p>
Curtains forcing their will
against the wind,
children sleep,
exchanging dreams with 
seraphim. The city
drags itself awake as a
rumor of war 
lie streching into dawn 
unasked and unheeded.
